# EightQueens_Puzzle

"The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal."
"If solutions that differ only by symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) of the board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 fundamental solutions."
